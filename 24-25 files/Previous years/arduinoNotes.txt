all arduino programs require two functions:
void setup() and void loop()

setup() is used to initialized variables 
and whatever settings that only need to be set once
setup() runs once after each powerup or reset of board

pinMode() and Serial.begin() are typical methods 
to see within setup code

dac.begin(): 
begins hardware and checks the DAC was found
takes in the I2C of the dac, which defaults to 0x62
also takes in the I2C TwoWire object, which defaults to &Wire

dac.setVoltage():
setVoltage(output, writeEEPROM, i2c_frequency) is a bool return method that 
sets output voltage to a fraction of source vref. 
output is 12bit value for DAC input to output voltage (uint16_t)
writeEEPROM: if true, 'output' will also be written to MCP4725's internal memory
(DAC will retain curr volt after power down)
i2c_freq sets I2C clock when writing to DAC, default set to 400KHz

analogWrite(MOTOR_PIN, map(voltage, 0, 2000, 0, 130));
analogWrite generates a PWM signal on the specified pin
takes in pin and a value between 0 and 255, where 255 is full speed

map() is an arduino function that converts the rang of one set of values
to another range. here converts DAC voltage into PWM values
5 args: x, in_min, in_max, out_min, out_max
x is the input value to be mapped. in params are ranges of the input value
(here 0 to 2000 from the DAC voltage), out is min/max of converted value
here, PWM range is 0 to 130 (remember PWM standard range is 0-255)
map() scales the voltage input value to PWM output value

serial.println should be sending all output to 
serial monitor (tools -> serial monitor to open)
